# Building

## Common commands

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Build everything | `dotnet build Vafadar.Apps.slnx` |
| Build one product | `dotnet build Vafadar.Zanance.slnf` |
| Build without MAUI (no workloads needed) | `dotnet build Vafadar.Tests.slnf` |
| MAUI projects for one platform only | `dotnet build Vafadar.Apps.slnx -p:VafadarMauiTargetFrameworks=net10.0-android` |
| Release build of an app for Android | `dotnet build src/Apps/Zanance/Vafadar.Zanance.App -c Release -f net10.0-android` |
| Build as CI does (warnings are errors) | add `-p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true` |
| Restore local tools | `dotnet tool restore` |

## Helper scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `eng/scripts/Add-Strings.ps1 -JsonPath strings.json` | Adds or updates UI strings in all languages (en, fa, de) of a `.resx` set in one step |
| `eng/scripts/Run-Snapshots.ps1 -Languages fa [-Theme dark] [-WindowSize 1280x820] [-Empty] [-Only budget,report] [-Mode simple]` | Builds the Windows Debug app, starts it with an empty development database (the existing one is moved to `Data-before-snapshots-*`, never deleted) and saves screenshots of every screen to `artifacts/snapshots`; `-WindowSize` checks wide windows, `-Empty` the empty states of a new user, `-Only` shoots the screens whose names start with the given prefixes, `-Mode simple` walks through Simple mode |
| `eng/scripts/Build-AndroidApk.ps1 [-Configuration Debug]` | Builds a complete Android APK for installing on a phone directly (`artifacts/android`); see below |
| `eng/scripts/Get-SigningInfo.ps1 [-Path <apk/aab>] [-Keystore <file> -Alias <alias>]` | Prints package name, version, SHA-1/SHA-256 fingerprints and the Entra signature hash for Google Cloud, Entra and Play Console |

The Windows Debug build also reads these environment variables (Debug builds only):

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `VAFADAR_START_ROUTE` | Opens a screen after the start, e.g. `//insights/budget` or `//plans;plan` (steps separated by `;`); the app stays open |
| `VAFADAR_WINDOW_SIZE` | The window size for the start route or the snapshots, e.g. `1280x820` (default `412x892`, a phone) |
| `VAFADAR_CAPTURE_WINDOW` | With `VAFADAR_START_ROUTE`: saves the whole window – title, navigation and page – as a PNG to this path, rendered by the app itself, so it also works while other windows cover the app; open dialogs are saved next to it (`<file>-popup1.png`, ...) |
| `VAFADAR_CAPTURE_DELAY` | Seconds before that capture (default 2), e.g. to open a dialog with UI Automation first |

### Installing on an Android phone without Visual Studio

The APK in `bin/Debug/net10.0-android` is made for **Fast Deployment**: Visual Studio copies the app's assemblies to the
device separately, so that APK alone stops at start (logcat: *No assemblies found … Fast Deployment*). For a phone or
for testers, build a complete APK with `eng/scripts/Build-AndroidApk.ps1` (Release by default, signed with the local
debug key) and install `artifacts/android/pro.vafadar.zanance-Signed.apk`. Android blocks screenshots of the app on purpose
(`FLAG_SECURE`, D-23); use the accessibility tree (`adb shell uiautomator dump`) to check screens on an emulator.

**Visual Studio open at the same time:** it restores the solution in the background for all target frameworks, which can
overwrite the restore of a command-line build for one framework. The build then stops with `NETSDK1005` (*assets file
doesn't have a target for 'net10.0-android'*) or `APT2126` (*file not found*). Run the command again – it restores
first – or close the solution in Visual Studio while building from the command line.

## Target frameworks

* Plain libraries, tests and (future) web projects: `$(VafadarTargetFramework)` = `net10.0`.
* MAUI projects: `$(VafadarMauiTargetFrameworks)`, which depends on the build machine:

  | Build OS | MAUI targets |
  |---|---|
  | Windows | `net10.0-android`, `net10.0-ios`, `net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0` |
  | macOS | `net10.0-android`, `net10.0-ios` |
  | Linux | `net10.0-android` |

  Passing `-p:VafadarMauiTargetFrameworks=...` on the command line overrides this for all projects – useful for
  faster local builds and used by CI.

## Warnings

The code builds without warnings. Locally warnings are shown; in CI (`ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true`, set
automatically on GitHub Actions) they are errors. Code style rules marked `warning` in `.editorconfig` are enforced
during the build.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests:

| Job | Runner | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Libraries and tests | Ubuntu | Builds `Vafadar.Tests.slnf` (Release) and runs all tests with coverage and TRX results |
| Android build | Ubuntu | Installs the Android workload and builds the whole solution for Android (Release, trimmed) |
| Windows build | Windows | Builds the whole solution for Windows (Release) |
| iOS build | macOS | Only on manual runs with "ios" checked; simulator build, no signing |

Other workflows:

* `codeql.yml` – security analysis of C# and workflow files (weekly and on changes).
* `release-android.yml` – manual: builds a signed `.aab` for Google Play (see [release guide](release-and-publishing.md)).
* Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) opens weekly update pull requests for NuGet packages, the SDK and actions.
