# 07 – Acceptance test plan

Automated tests live in `test/Apps/Finance/*` and carry the scenario id in their name or a `[Trait("AT", "AT-17")]`.
Manual scenarios are executed on a real Android device with the **release** build (Gate 1B). The reference device and
data set (10,000 entries, 20 accounts, 100 active plans) are defined in slice S14.
