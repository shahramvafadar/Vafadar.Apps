# 04 – Phase 1 implementation plan

Each slice is a usable vertical increment: domain + persistence + UI + tests, committed separately. A slice is done
only when its acceptance scenarios pass; status is tracked in the table at the end.

D-62 maintenance (2026-10-08): S2 offers theme/experience choices and existing-backup restore without a new
account; S6 allows optional password protection for local and cloud destinations. Tests cover protected and
unprotected packages, preserved preferences, no duplicate account and an empty profile. Cloud sign-in and
physical-device gates remain open; current tracking is ZCR-LOC-11.

## Phase 1A – everyday ledger

| Slice | Goal | Scope | Acceptance | Migration / recovery risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 Ledger core | Correct numbers before any UI | Money/Currency, entities, entry kinds, balance/report/budget calculators, first EF migration, repositories | AT-02, 05–08, 11–15, 39–40, 45, 47, **62 golden** (unit tests) | First migration defines the schema; later changes additive only |
| S2 Shell, onboarding, accounts | Start without login | New navigation (D-11), light theme (dark added by D-22), branding (final: D-26), onboarding, accounts list/editor/archive, finance settings | AT-01, 09, 10 | Settings in DB (part of backups) |
| S3 Entry editor and list | Daily recording | Categories (defaults + custom), icon font, entry editor (expense/income/transfer, foreign amount, fee), list with search/filters, detail, refund, duplicate, delete with undo | AT-02–08, 12–15, 48 (manual) | Double-save guard (AT-03) |
| S4 Plans core | Plans ≠ ledger | Recurrence engine (Gregorian/Persian), schedules, occurrences, plan editor with preview, review/confirm/skip/move/link, split "this and future", auto-post processor | AT-16–33 | Unique indexes (D-06/D-07) |
| S5 Home dashboard | Explainable overview | Home cards with one filter set, needs-review, next due, donut | AT-49 (partly), 50 | – |
| S6 Local backup UI | Data survives | Settings in package, safety copy before restore, encrypted file export/import, preview, fresh-install restore | AT-56–58, 60 | Restore replaces DB atomically |

**Gate 1A:** AT-62 exact, reliable save/edit, no transfer double counting, plans vs ledger clear, local restore proven.

## Phase 1B – complete first product

| Slice | Scope | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| S7 Budget | Monthly total + category limits, scope, alerts 80/100 %, copy to next month, budget calendar | AT-39–41 |
| S8 Reports | All phase-1 reports with drill-down, incomplete labels | AT-13, 46, 50 |
| S9 Forecast | Horizon end of month / 30 / 90 days, path + minimum, assumptions | AT-42–44 |
| S10 Reminders | Local notifications, permission on demand, privacy text, rescheduling, summary | AT-34–38 |
| S11 Multi-currency | Manual rates, report currency, incomplete totals | AT-45–47 |
| S12 Import/Export | CSV export (safe), CSV import with mapping, preview, duplicates, batch undo | AT-51–55 |
| S13 Simple/Advanced + app lock | Mode switch preserving data, device-credential/biometric lock, lock on resume/notification/export | AT-49, 61 |
| S14 Hardening | Localization completeness, accessibility pass, performance with 10,000 entries, release build tests | AT-48, Q-02 |
| S15 Cloud backup (conditional) | Implemented (D-35); released only when the OAuth clients are configured and the device test passes | AT-59 |

**Gate 1B:** every phase-1 scenario passes on the release build (except explicitly unshipped cloud destinations);
privacy policy, Data safety and Financial features declaration match that build.

## Status

| Slice | Status |
|---|---|
| S1 | Implemented – verified (domain + persistence; 59 new tests; migration InitialLedger) |
| S2 | Implemented – verified (Android/Windows builds; en/de/fa screens reviewed via Debug snapshots; AT-10 unit-tested: history and ending the active plans) |
| S3 | Implemented – verified (entry editor, list with search/filters, detail, refund, duplicate, delete with undo, categories; 27 new tests; en/de/fa snapshots reviewed) |

| S8 | Implemented – verified (expenses by category with gross chart, refunds card and net table; income and expense with savings share; 6/12-month trend with partial months marked; account movement from opening to closing balance; plan vs actual; drill-down with the same period and scope) |
| S9 | Implemented – verified (end of month / 30 / 90 days, start from recorded balance, open occurrences only, overdue assumed at base date, future-dated entries, unknown amounts mark the result incomplete, daily path with minimum and shortfall warning; AT-42–44 unit-tested) |
| S10 | Implemented – verified (reminder planner: future reminders only, capped, stable ids; rebuilt on start, resume, every change, restore and language change; generic lock-screen text unless details are allowed; permission on demand; tap opens the occurrence; budget alerts once per level; Windows keeps the in-app due centre) |
| S11 | Implemented – verified (manual rates with date and estimate flag, latest rate on or before a date, inverse rates, combined balance on Home only when every rate exists with the rate date shown, missing rates listed; recorded amounts, budgets and history never converted) |
| S12 | Implemented – verified (CSV export with ISO dates, invariant amounts, transfers as one row, optional notes, formula neutralisation and a sensitivity warning; import of own files by id without duplicates and of other files with explicit column, date, calendar, decimal and sign choices; preview with invalid lines, possible duplicates and pre-opening rows; atomic batch with undo; AT-51–55 tested) |
| S13 | Implemented – verified on Windows/Android builds (Simple/Advanced as views of the same data: advanced plan, budget and entry options, Home forecast card, summaries of hidden settings; app lock with device biometrics or credential via a shared library authenticator, cover on leaving, 30 s grace, notification taps after unlock, confirmation for export/backup/restore, Android FLAG_SECURE); device checks pending |
| S14 | Implemented – verified (resource completeness, keys used in code exist, no empty translations; 10,000-entry calculation budget; migration upgrade test; licence list; release checklist updated). Device accessibility and performance runs remain for the release (08) |
| S16 Spec review | Implemented – verified (gaps found by comparing with the English specification v1.1: account detail and reconciliation, archive ends plans, icons for accounts and entries, income reversal and "make recurring", category order and merge, budget account scope, category filter, delete all data, forecast what-if, reminder summary and due-date reminder, plan report variance, Home guidance, Q-02 data set, quick templates, unknown opening balance with data-quality indicator, region and first day of the week in the shared localization library, notification snooze; remaining deviations in spec Section 31.3) |
| S15 | Implemented – unverified (D-35, D-50): OneDrive and Google Drive on Android, iOS and Windows in builds with OAuth client ids; the device test with real clients is still open, and builds without clients keep the offline behaviour (encrypted backup files cover BAK-01..12) |

D-63 privacy maintenance: device-wide four-digit PIN, durable attempt limiting, authenticated recovery and Android
screenshot choice are implemented in ZCR-SEC-10. Broader database/key encryption and device acceptance stay open.

## D-65 maintenance

S2 account setup and S4 plan setup have clearer debt direction, optional terms and date-anchored recurrence controls.
The data/settlement model is unchanged. Local validation is recorded under AT-72 / ZCR-LOC-13; physical-device
acceptance remains open. This maintenance does not reopen or approve another commercial section.

D-67 maintenance: automatic connected-backup discovery with destination feedback and cross-profile restore lists;
independent regional formats/digits/holidays in first run and settings, with portable display choices. Local validation
uses AT-73/74; real-provider and physical-device acceptance remain open in S15/AT-59.


SEC-01 research (D-68, 2026-10-08) prepares ADR 0010 and an independent fictitious encryption harness. Production
database encryption is still absent; Windows and isolated Android API 36 x86_64 runtime proof pass, including
Keystore-wrapped fictitious profile recovery after process restart. Architecture acceptance awaits owner review.


D-69 / SEC-09 reviews the existing SDK and Android Release permission baseline with separate Offline/Cloud artifacts.
No Phase 1 finance or OS-backup behaviour changed; see the canonical backlog and SDK review for remaining gates.

D-70 / LOC-02 is a Phase 2 goal contribution reminder using the existing Phase 1 platform scheduler. Generic privacy,
contextual permission and app-lock navigation stay the same; there is no new ledger, schema or permission.

D-71 / LOC-03 adds a profile-level optional financial-period review reminder using the existing notification
permission, privacy and scheduling infrastructure. No Phase 1 ledger invariants or cloud/network capabilities change.

D-72 / LOC-04 completes the remaining aggregate-import overlap choices above the Phase 1 CSV pipeline. Explicit
choices, atomic stale-preview checks and durable Undo use an additive ImportLinks table; no automatic merge or
ledger invariant change. AT-79 local/emulator evidence and the phone/iOS gates live in the acceptance plan.

D-73 / QA-03 adds regression coverage around implemented Phase 1 onboarding, profile switching, application access,
widget/reminder navigation and theme policy. Explicit native ports keep actual flow sources testable without a MAUI
UI dependency. AT-80 is local engineering/runtime evidence; owner phone, real OAuth and iOS acceptance stay open.

D-74 / QA-04 adds 37 AT-81 cases for the existing entry-editor valued-asset consent, including cancellation before
mutation, busy command exclusion, translated native requests and real SQLite validation. No Phase 1 scope or data
model change. Main suite 1,300; native/phone acceptance remains separate.

D-75 / Q-02 hardening records explicit reference and tenfold performance workloads and keeps large entry reads
outside the UI thread. Account indexes call the original balance formula. AT-82 adds 23 cases (main suite 1,323);
actual native timing/ANR/search-row observations and remaining physical-device objectives are in
quality/performance-q02.md. No schema, commercial limit or release acceptance change.

D-76 / AT-83 covers the transaction page until snapshot publication, with disabled input and failure/retry feedback.
Twelve new application cases bring the main suite to 1,335. This follows the D-75 early-input finding without changing
financial semantics or closing native duration, ANR, physical-device or iOS acceptance.

D-83 / AT-90 maintains existing child-page headers and native Back descriptions without changing Phase 1 scope.
Actual running Windows/emulator evidence and the complete signed APK are in quality/font-scaling-a11y03.md;
main suite remains 1,345 passing. OS/screen-reader/device/iOS and remaining layout/draft findings stay open.

D-84 resolves the independently observed Settings nested-return estimate reset. Full covered refresh remains;
raw unsaved text/period/currency stay scoped to the current profile/settings row. Save accepts only successfully
submitted input; no autosave, financial rule or schema change. AT-91 adds 13 cases, and the real retained-body
runtime route now checks drafts after nested return. See quality/settings-estimate-draft.md for final evidence/APK.
Continue modal/Insights/custom-control and other ready work under D-69; unresolved owner/platform gates remain.

D-85 continues A11Y-03 with all four visible Windows Insights destinations in a growing navigation row above
the retained body. Narrow windows reflow into two columns; wide readable content shows four. AT-92 invokes the
actual native routes and checks complete caption/selection/target geometry and unchanged stored data. Final
evidence/APK and independent platform/other-control limits are in quality/insights-navigation.md.

D-86 continues A11Y-03 with complete wrapped budget identities and separate full-width spending/limit and
envelope readouts, retaining compact native typography. A separately reproduced MoneyText signed-boundary crash
is repaired by taking the magnitude after decimal conversion; input range and financial calculations stay unchanged.
AT-93 adds 11 independent Core cases and actual native scroll/geometry/data-equality checks. Final evidence and
remaining physical OS/screen-reader/device/iOS gates are in quality/budget-readouts.md. No schema or new strings.

D-87 continues A11Y-03 by keeping all three budget period decisions visible in the existing wrapping choice group.
An actual pre-change native check fails for the hidden third option. AT-94 measures full native captions/targets,
invokes the existing three choices, restores selection and compares complete stored data without Save. No shared
control, financial calculation, schema or new string change. Final evidence and independent OS/screen-reader/
physical-device/iOS gates are in quality/budget-periods.md.

D-89 continues A11Y-03 with complete growing tag suggestions and original-value native selection. AT-95 checks
84 actual native invocations and 21 exact draft/stored-data restorations across the three-language/theme/width
matrix; normal signed Android Release confirms selection, Keep editing and Discard without financial writes.
Main suite remains 1,369 (App.Tests 140); strict Windows and equivalent-command Android Release have no warnings/errors.
PowerShell startup blocks the canonical APK/privacy scripts locally; the complete signed package and matching binary
policy are independently verified. Evidence and remaining tooling/OS/screen-reader/phone/iOS/owner gates:
[quality/tag-suggestions.md](quality/tag-suggestions.md).

D-90 continues A11Y-03 with state-matched transaction detail actions and retained unsaved fields. AT-96 checks
48 actual native Invoke operations and 24 complete draft/stored-row restorations, including Simple/Advanced initial
visibility. Main suite remains 1,369 (App.Tests 140); strict Windows and canonical Android Release have zero warnings/
errors. Normal signed Release passes hide/show, retained payee/tag/note values and Keep editing/Discard in en/fa/de;
complete fictitious financial rows remain unchanged. Canonical APK/privacy scripts and full package/signature pass.
Evidence and independent OS/screen-reader/phone/iOS/provider/owner gates:
[quality/entry-details-disclosure.md](quality/entry-details-disclosure.md).

D-91 / AT-97 keeps both first-run restore alternatives fully readable and retains their existing navigation/busy
bindings. The final Windows matrix and signed Android Release pass; 1,369 tests (App.Tests 140), zero-warning strict
builds and full installable APK/privacy checks. See [quality/onboarding-restore-actions.md](quality/onboarding-restore-actions.md)
for native draft/stored-data preservation and independent platform/physical-device/provider/owner gates.

D-92 / AT-98 removes measured redundant Home row/goal work while retaining complete values and financial rules.
All 1,384 tests pass (App.Tests 148), strict builds and complete signed Release APK/privacy/native checks pass.
Controlled tenfold Windows warm reload median: 2,727.70 -> 1,228.28 ms. QA-06 remains partial: entry materialization,
cold start/ANR and physical-device Q-02 are open. See [quality/performance-home-snapshots.md](quality/performance-home-snapshots.md).

D-93 fixes the Windows-only Home diagnostic call that broke Android Debug, with no Release/UI/financial behavior
change. Final Windows/Android Debug/Release builds and all 1,384 tests (App.Tests 148) pass. Temporary native stage
measurements identify entry materialization/initial account creation; QA-06 and physical/platform acceptance remain
open. Evidence: [quality/home-debug-platform-and-native-stages.md](quality/home-debug-platform-and-native-stages.md).

D-94 completes the local Customize Home caption/target follow-up: all eight section identities grow at full
width above the original controls, with 44 px targets and a complete Reset action. AT-99 final en/fa/de theme/width/
200% review and 84 native operations, 1,384 main tests, strict Windows/Android Debug/Release builds and signed Release
owned-sample readbacks pass. A11Y-03, QA-06 and real device/platform acceptance remain partial/open.
Evidence: [quality/home-customization-readable.md](quality/home-customization-readable.md).

D-95 / AT-100 removes measured eager native row construction for hidden Home Accounts while retaining the
complete snapshot and every shown account/action. Native tenfold publication median: 5,339.89 -> 10.69 ms, with no
total cold-start/Q-02 acceptance claim. Final language/theme/width/200% native visibility/detail/list checks, 1,384
main tests, strict Windows/Android Debug/Release builds, signed Release and complete owned-sample readbacks pass.
QA-06 full entry materialization, visible creation, cold duration/ANR and real device/platform acceptance remain open.
Evidence: [quality/home-hidden-account-views.md](quality/home-hidden-account-views.md).

D-96 / AT-101 completes account type/default/excluded/incomplete captions in the shared account row at large
native text, retaining complete text, flags, balances and row actions. Final en/fa/de themes/widths/200% and normal
text checks cover all eight flag combinations; 1,384 main tests, strict Windows/Android Debug/Release builds, signed
Release navigation and exact 24-table original-sample readbacks pass. A11Y-03 other controls/modals and actual OS,
screen-reader, phone/iOS and release acceptance remain open.
Evidence: [quality/account-descriptions-readable.md](quality/account-descriptions-readable.md).

D-97 / AT-102 completes the existing Accounts debt/receivable action caption with a growing real button,
unchanged text/scaling/command and native open/cancel verification of the same unsaved Loan form. Complete stored
accounts/entries/settings/budgets/schedules remain unchanged. Final en/fa/de themes/widths/200% and normal text,
1,384 tests, strict Windows/Android Debug/Release, signed Release navigation and exact 24-table readbacks pass.
A11Y-03 other controls and actual OS/readers/phone/iOS/release acceptance remain open.
Evidence: [quality/debt-entry-action-readable.md](quality/debt-entry-action-readable.md).

D-98 / AT-103 removes duplicated Windows modal titles and reflows all eleven existing modal title/Cancel
rows without changing forms or financial behavior. Actual glyph/name/target/no-overlap and native Cancel/parent
Back pass across all Windows language/theme/width/text contexts; all nine complete stored data sources remain.
Normal Android debt/expense/plan forms pass in three languages and both themes; original three-profile tables
remain identical. All 1,384 tests, strict Windows/Android Debug/Release and complete signed APK checks pass.
A11Y-03 other controls and actual OS/readers/phone/iOS/release acceptance remain open.
Evidence: [quality/modal-headers-readable.md](quality/modal-headers-readable.md).

D-99 / AT-104 collects all applicable plan-field problems in one invalid Save attempt, displays destination
feedback beside its input and reveals the first problem using fresh native layout. Drafts and complete stored
Accounts/Entries/Settings/Schedules remain; existing money/recurrence/unknown-amount rules are unchanged.
Twenty-four new behaviour cases bring the main suite to 1,408 (App.Tests 172). Full Windows language/theme/width
review, strict Windows/Android Debug/Release, normal Android invalid Save/cancel, signed APK and original 24-table
readbacks pass. Other A11Y-03 controls and OS/readers/phone/iOS/owner/release gates remain open.
Evidence: [quality/plan-validation-visible.md](quality/plan-validation-visible.md).

D-100 / AT-105 collects independent transaction monetary problems before mutation, shows each beside its
input, reveals the next affected field and reopens invalid collapsed details without replacing entered values.
Existing parsers, consent/receipt protections and successful ledger/fee/overlap/attachment ordering remain.
Forty-eight new cases bring the main suite to 1,456 (App.Tests 220). Complete Windows matrix, strict builds,
normal Android invalid Save/cancel, signed APK and original 24-table readbacks pass. Simple destination-fee
retention is a separate pending runtime concern; other controls/platform/owner/release gates remain open.
Evidence: [quality/entry-validation-visible.md](quality/entry-validation-visible.md).

D-101 / AT-106 closes the reproduced destination-fee loss in successful Simple edits. Existing fees stay
visible/editable in both modes; new destination-fee creation remains Advanced-only. Native retention, explicit
edit/removal and reopened/new Cancel/Discard preserve financial fields/ids and unrelated rows. The final
Windows matrix has 24 contexts/72 valid Saves; main tests remain 1,456 (App.Tests 220), strict builds and signed
APK pass. Normal Android creation-policy checks and original financial/preference values and expected settings audit pass; successful stored-fee
editing on Android/physical/iOS and other owner/platform/release gates remain open.
Evidence: [quality/destination-fee-retention.md](quality/destination-fee-retention.md).

D-102 / AT-107 delivers complete settlement period/bill feedback and a growing Record the difference
action. Invalid Save reveals the first affected input without changing the draft; original advance/refund logic
retains zero bills and no-op exact bills. Fourteen new cases bring the main suite to 1,470 (App.Tests 234).
The final Windows matrix has 24 contexts/144 invalid and 72 valid native Saves; six normal-scale Release Android
contexts/18 invalid Saves, strict builds, signed APK and original financial/preference-value checks pass.
Normal Settings audit updates are separate; physical/iOS/readers, valid Android settlement acceptance and other
owner/platform/release gates remain open. Evidence: [quality/settlement-feedback.md](quality/settlement-feedback.md).

D-103 / AT-108 completes due-item action captions and correctly placed payment/override feedback, with independent
corrections and native revelation of the actual affected field. Fourteen new cases bring the main suite to 1,484
(App.Tests 248). Windows: 24 contexts/96 invalid and 96 valid native Saves, plus a separate 24-context/96-invalid
final contextual-message review with no additional financial Saves; normal-scale Release Android:
six contexts/18 invalid Saves. Actual metadata changes never post entries; partial payment and completion retain
the intended entries and unique settlement. Original financial rows/states are preserved/restored; strict builds
and the complete signed phone-test APK pass. Phone/iOS/readers, valid Android occurrence acceptance and other
owner/platform/release gates remain open. Evidence: [quality/occurrence-feedback.md](quality/occurrence-feedback.md).

D-104 / AT-109 delivers complete transaction row reuse for repeated filters, scoped to one data/display snapshot.
Four new tests pass (main 1,488). Final running-app/build/APK checks and measured performance limits are recorded in
[quality/transaction-row-reuse.md](quality/transaction-row-reuse.md). QA-06 and real device/platform/release gates remain open.

D-105 / AT-110 removes repeated full-ledger membership scans from complete bulk-selection reload. Final tests/runtime/build/APK evidence: [quality/bulk-selection-reload.md](quality/bulk-selection-reload.md). Cold/device/ANR/native-publication and owner acceptance gates remain open.

D-106 / AT-111 removes unrelated ledger materialization from the unchanged Settings suggestion. Main suite: 1,512 passed, App.Tests 276. Final runtime/build/APK evidence: [quality/settings-suggestion-history.md](quality/settings-suggestion-history.md). Cold/device/ANR/platform and owner acceptance remain independent.

D-107 / AT-112 continues A11Y-03 with complete growing Windows selected/popup picker captions, inherited native
typography and 44-unit popup targets. Native reviews retain choices/drafts/full stored values without Save;
main suite remains 1,512 passed (App.Tests 276). Final native matrix, strict Windows/complete Android Debug+Release, exact original-data readbacks and signed APK pass: [quality/native-picker-captions.md](quality/native-picker-captions.md).
Other controls and actual OS/readers/device/iOS/release acceptance remain open. Continue ready work under D-69.

D-108 / AT-113 addresses actual clipped report-scope captions/off-page Clear actions and a zero-height transaction
result at large text. Final 21 Windows native contexts, main 1,512 tests (App.Tests 276), strict builds, actual
normal Release report/navigation/Clear, exact original-data readbacks and complete signed D-108 APK pass: [transaction-scope-readable.md](quality/transaction-scope-readable.md). A11Y-03 and independent
platform/OS/readers/device/owner/release gates remain open; continue ready work under D-69.

D-109 / AT-114 fixes observed inheritance of unrelated report scope when applying a named transaction filter.
Preserve the saved combination and complete financial data. Final six native contexts/18 independent report
restrictions, main 1,512 tests, strict builds, normal Release, exact original-data readbacks and signed APK pass:
[quality/saved-filter-report-scope.md](quality/saved-filter-report-scope.md). Provider/device/iOS and owner gates remain open.

D-110 / AT-115 avoids native rebuilding of completely unchanged transaction results while retaining every
ordered row, caption and boundary. Fresh data/display snapshots still publish. Main 1,521/App.Tests 285;
six native Windows contexts, strict builds, normal Release, original-data readbacks and signed APK pass:
[quality/unchanged-transaction-source.md](quality/unchanged-transaction-source.md).
Cold/ANR/physical-device/iOS/provider and owner/release gates remain open.

D-111 / approved OD-12 implements Repeat from a new transaction into an unsaved monthly Plan without posting
money. Preserve original complete drafts, named calendar dates, currency identities and safe defaults. Main 1,535/
App.Tests 299, final financial/presentation matrices, strict builds, normal signed Release Plan Save/cleanup,
exact original-data readbacks and complete signed APK pass:
[quality/entry-repeat-draft.md](quality/entry-repeat-draft.md). Provider/physical/iOS/owner/release gates remain open.

D-113 / AT-117 delivers complete growing transaction category choices, retaining original raw selection identity
without Save. Main 1,535/App.Tests 299, Windows 33-context/99-selection review, strict builds, normal signed
Release selection/discard and exact 24-table original-sample readbacks pass. Complete signed D-113 APK is ready:
[quality evidence](quality/entry-category-captions.md). Other A11Y-03/device/iOS/OS-reader/provider/owner gates stay open.

D-117 / ENT-01 implements the owner-approved final Core commercial model (OD-03), with no app enforcement.
76 new policy cases; main suite 1,611, App.Tests 299 unchanged. Phase/runtime/release acceptance stays separate:
[quality evidence](quality/entitlement-policy.md). ENT-02 service checks follow with activation still gated.

D-118 continues ENT-02 with the actual-file account write transaction boundary; test-build limits stay inactive.
15 added SQLite cases/main 1,626 pass. The rest of ENT-02 and runtime/release acceptance remain open:
[quality evidence](quality/account-write-policy.md).

D-119 continues ENT-02 with actual-file template/filter write transactions, slot-preserving edits/replacements
and atomic failure recovery. Current enforcement stays inactive. 24 added SQLite cases/main 1,650 pass; the
remaining resources/import/restore/read-only/native paths and release gates stay open:
[quality evidence](quality/template-filter-write-policy.md).

D-120 continues ENT-02 with Goal Save and whole Plan batch/split transactions, counted pauses and slot-neutral
continuations. 45 added SQLite cases/main 1,695 pass. Current deployment stays inactive; contribution/allocation/
occurrence work, other resources/import/restore/read-only/native paths and activation remain open:
[quality evidence](quality/goal-plan-write-policy.md).

D-121 continues ENT-02 with current-period budget Save/confirmed Replace, canonical financial definitions and
complete replacement rollback. 26 added SQLite cases/main 1,721 pass. Current deployment stays inactive; explicit
active/read-only selection, future-period activation and other ENT-02/03 paths remain unfinished:
[quality evidence](quality/budget-write-policy.md).

D-122 continues ENT-02 with actual-file holding write rights, retained corrections/delete/Undo and atomic
purchase/payment/fee/derived-price Save. 46 added SQLite cases/main 1,767 pass. Current deployment stays inactive;
explicit read-only/import selection, other resources/operations/native paths and activation remain unfinished:
[quality evidence](quality/holding-write-policy.md).

D-123 continues ENT-02 with retained earmark/release rights and contribution operations, plus one atomic
goal/pin/contribution editor Save. 39 added SQLite cases/main 1,806 pass. Current registration remains inactive;
selected read-only items, contribution delivery and remaining ENT-02/03/04 paths stay open:
[quality evidence](quality/goal-contribution-write-policy.md).

D-124 continues ENT-02 with exact-file database backup/recovery and retained import/Undo checks. Restore binds
the destination before input and migrates the same file, correcting an actual reproduced redirection defect.
28 added SQLite cases/main 1,834 pass. Current registration stays inactive; selected read-only import/restore data,
profiles, automation and remaining ENT-02/03 paths stay open: [quality evidence](quality/recovery-write-policy.md).

D-125 continues ENT-02 with actual-file category rule creation/correction/deletion rights and serialized
same-pattern replacement, including current unrestricted builds. 28 added SQLite cases/main 1,862 pass.
No stored transaction is reclassified. Registration stays inactive; suggestion delivery, selected read-only data,
profiles, automation and remaining ENT-02/03/04 paths stay open: [quality evidence](quality/category-rule-write-policy.md).

D-126 continues ENT-02 with actual-file ledger Save rights, complete split/holding/transfer groups and
final-batch refund validation. 45 added SQLite cases/main 1,907 pass. Four reproduced refund defects corrected;
entry/attachment/paid-total rollback retained. Registration inactive; ledger delete/Undo, selected read-only data,
automation and remaining ENT-02/03/04 paths stay open: [quality evidence](quality/ledger-write-policy.md).

D-127 continues ENT-02 with actual-file ledger Delete/Undo, explicit file-bound refund snapshots and
retry-safe application offers. 38 added cases/main 1,945 pass; App.Tests 308. Receipt orphan/purge behavior stays
unchanged, without extra byte copies. Registration inactive; selected read-only data, automation, commercial
feedback and remaining ENT-02/03/04 paths remain open: [quality evidence](quality/ledger-undo-write-policy.md).

D-128 reports actual transaction Undo/refresh failures through the existing translated dialog, preserving the
original retry deadline and blocking repeated invocation through pending feedback. Nine added actual-command cases;
main 1,954 / App.Tests 317 pass. Six normal installed Release failure flows retain committed financial data and
receipt bytes. No activation changes. Later refund edits during Undo and visible ledger Save feedback remain open:
[quality evidence](quality/transaction-undo-feedback.md).

D-129 makes short ledger Undo snapshots independent of returned mutable rows and rejects obsolete refund,
partial-group and account-currency dependencies before writes. 18 added cases/main 1,972 pass; App.Tests 318.
Normal/conflicted installed Release checks preserve complete data/receipts; current enforcement stays inactive.
Native editor timing, visible ledger Save feedback and remaining ENT-02/03/04/external gates remain open:
[quality evidence](quality/ledger-undo-conflicts.md).

D-130 delivers the observed D-126 Save-feedback follow-up: existing general transaction errors stay beside
fixed Save, with native scalable wrapping text and complete spoken names. Explicit rejected Save/retry/storage
failure retain reviewed draft fields and stored rows; field validation clears obsolete general feedback. No data,
permission, algorithm or commercial activation changes. Remaining ENT-02/03/04 and external gates stay open:
[evidence](quality/entry-save-feedback-visible.md).

D-131 continues ENT-02/03 with the explicit Core resource-choice projection and actual ledger account selection,
verified retained overdue payments and serialized reviewed advance bills. 79 added cases/main 2,051 pass;
App.Tests 318. Current test builds remain unrestricted. Selection UI/persistence, other bindings/automation and
external gates remain open: [quality evidence](quality/selected-account-write-policy.md).

D-140 binds actual Plan/contract notification delivery and snooze rebuilding to the opened file and current
explicit plan choice. Original group members, recurrence identities and effective dates survive snooze; current
privacy/language/text is rebuilt from stored rows. Unprovable legacy snooze caches are discarded while normal
reminders are rebuilt; legacy navigation remains readable. Notification taps resolve the current file after
unlocking, without profile guessing or money writes. Reserve the snooze id marker so a hashed occurrence id cannot
keep the original deadline. Registration remains inactive. Choice UI/persistence, other selected resources and
external acceptance remain open. [Evidence](quality/selected-plan-reminders.md).

## D-141 delivery - Durable financial resource choices

ENT-02/03 account/Plan choice persistence and actual writer/reminder binding are delivered without commercial
activation. Additive schema, explicit scoped Save and retained history/correction behavior: 44 new AT-143 cases,
main 2,374 / App.Tests 382 pass. Chooser UI, other resources/operations and owner/external gates remain open.
[Evidence](quality/durable-resource-choices.md).

## D-142 delivered account/Plan chooser

The reviewed Settings account/Plan form is delivered with covered loading, explicit scoped Save, preserved draft
feedback, separate original states and current unrestricted-build explanation. 25 new AT-144 flows; main 2,399 /
App.Tests 407 pass. Strict builds, actual native layout/navigation and complete signed APK are recorded in
[the quality record](quality/active-item-chooser.md). ENT-02/03 remain in progress for other resource choices,
operations/bindings and future activation; owner/external gates remain open.

## D-143 delivered durable goal writer

Extend the existing ResourceSelections boundary to Goals without a schema/entity change. Reviewed original names,
measurement kinds, currency and active/paused/completed/archived states are rechecked with actual file, financial
scope, verified rights, stored revision and capacity. Free's one goal counts a pause; explicit empty is retained.
Invalid/stale choices need review, and choosing an advanced retained goal never grants its paid tools.

The goal writer reads stored choice under the actual SQLite writer; it overrides only cached choice, never
entitlement/membership. Explicit new or reopened goals join a free chosen slot atomically, rather than counting
unselected retained history again. Completion/archive/delete releases only that identity; pause keeps it.
Unselected paused goals cannot resume. Retained notes/state corrections, negative earmark releases and deletion
remain available. Positive earmarks independently require AdvancedGoals and usable goal/account choices; no ledger
or balance is written. Full editor/contribution failures roll back goal, pins, plan and choice together.

Current release registration remains inactive and unrestricted. Settings still exposes Accounts/Plans. Goal
chooser UI, effective goal/contribution projection and native reminder delivery follow in subsequent ENT-02/03
slices. Other selected resources, activation and owner/provider/device/iOS/publication gates remain open.

31 new AT-145 real SQLite cases; normal parallel main 2,430 / App.Tests 407 pass, zero failures/skips (69.359 s).
Strict Windows/Android have zero warnings/errors. Normal signed Release actual goal/contribution/earmark Save and
exact owned-file restoration are verified on the owned emulator. No visible layout change. Complete signed APK
verified. [Evidence](quality/goal-resource-choices.md).

## D-144 delivered goal chooser

The existing Settings availability form now has Accounts, Plans and Savings goals as three growing native choices.
Read the original goal name, measurement kind and state from the actual D-143 scoped snapshot; money goals also show
their original currency, while holding-quantity goals do not display a currency as their unit. Completed goals say
Completed rather than the Plan-specific Ended. Paused goals count toward Free's one-goal allowance without resuming.
Completed/archived identities remain readable and unselectable. No goal, allocation, contribution or ledger write
occurs while selecting, navigating, refreshing captions or discarding a draft.

Explicit Save uses the reviewed actual-file writer, including empty choices and malformed-choice repair. Preserve
the exact goal draft/index/identity on stale name/kind/currency/rights or storage failure and on live language change.
Keep existing consent/busy guard, covered publication/retry, pinned Save/error and committed-review retirement.
Current unrestricted registration requires no subset or Save and grants no fake paid rights. Choosing an advanced
goal never grants its paid tools; translated explanation/example make this explicit in all six existing languages.

Goal chooser UI is delivered. Effective goal/contribution projection and native reminder filtering/routing remain
the next ENT-02/03 binding slice; other resources/operations, activation and owner/external gates remain open.

18 new AT-146 actual application cases; normal parallel main 2,448 / App.Tests 425 pass (71.008 s), no failures/skips.
Strict Windows/Android zero warnings/errors. Actual form and registered Settings/Help/Goals/Back each pass the
18-case English/Persian/German, light/dark, 360/412/wide matrix with process-local font stress. Six normal signed
Release own-emulator cases, exact original byte/display restoration and complete signed APK verified.
[Evidence](quality/goal-chooser.md).

## D-145 delivered actual goal work and scoped reminders

Read complete original goals, saved contribution rules and allocations from the actual opened database, with
new-work eligibility kept separate from original financial progress. Selection never changes funding/protection,
resumes a paused goal or grants a paid tool. Free balance-goal activity, advanced goal work and contribution reminders
are independent rights. Missing, empty, malformed, foreign and historical choices keep their original data.

New paid contribution work checks the actual chosen goal under the same SQLite writer. A paired new goal can join
its slot before that check; reject failed activity before pin/protection normalization. Retained amount corrections,
reminder disabling/removal and negative earmark releases stay available. These operations never post ledger money.

Prepare goal reminders only for eligible original progress before the pending cap. Keep saved opt-in, generic/details
privacy, fixed 09:00 device-local rule dates, existing permission and the shared bounded queue. Native returning data
contains bounded original goal/date members and an opaque actual-file identity. Taps resolve that file after unlocking,
open the existing single detail or Goals root, and never switch profiles or grant new work. Retained history remains
readable after a choice change. Existing legacy historical links remain supported.

Validate actual file, cached rights, persisted choice revision and original goal/rule/allocation input stamp before
and after native publication; clear a retired queue, including failed snapshot preparation. The stamp is transient,
invariant and reflection-free, not a new schema, portable preference or credential. Current commercial registration
remains inactive and unrestricted. Goal-view contribution affordances and other remaining bindings follow separately.

36 new AT-147 actual application/real SQLite cases; focused 36 pass (9.147 s). Normal parallel main 2,484 /
App.Tests 461 pass (71.478 s), no failures/skips; test output cleaned. Strict Windows 15.49 s / Android 35.35 s,
zero warnings/errors. Six normal signed Release owned-emulator cases cover English/Persian/German, light/dark,
actual native stored single/group Intent routing, original destinations/Back, and rejection in another real profile.
The real pending queue retains all three original goals, bounded members, generic privacy and saved dates at 09:00.
No financial Save; complete original rows and exact owned bytes/sidecars plus Main/English/System restored.
This verifies stored native requests and actual Android Intent delivery, not future alarm firing at 09:00.
Complete signed installable APK verified. No layout/copy change; D-144 geometry evidence remains revision-specific.
Physical-phone, iOS, provider, OS accessibility, Store signing/publication and commercial activation remain unaccepted.

[Evidence](quality/goal-work-reminders.md).

## D-146 goal-view delivery

Original goal views, reviewed detail writes and historical negative releases are delivered under continuous authorization. Main 2,520 / App.Tests 497 pass; strict builds, Windows native matrices, six normal Release owned-emulator cases and complete signed APK verified. Phase 1 history remains implemented; commercial ENT-02/03 and external release gates remain open.

[Evidence](quality/goal-work-views.md).

## D-147 goal-editor delivery

40 new AT-149 actual-source/real SQLite cases pass. Final normal parallel main 2,560 / App.Tests 537 pass,
zero failures/skips; test output cleaned. Strict Windows and Android builds and canonical Release APK build have zero
warnings/errors. Eighteen English/Persian/German, light/dark, 360/412/wide contexts check the actual Advanced and Simple
modal at process-local 1.5 font stress: complete changed glyphs, real 44-pixel Invoke targets, stale Save rejection,
retained reviewed reload/current saved summary and native Close. All 25 complete fixture tables and original development
data/sidecar bytes are restored. The review uses independent fictitious data and explicit native-effect answers, not
replacement MAUI controls or a production entitlement replacement.

Six normal signed Release owned-emulator cases check the original archived account, uncommon rule, multiple-category
warning, pinned Save and native Close/Back. One actual note-only Save succeeds; complete original rule/categories,
accounts, ledger, allocations and other metadata stay equal. Only that goal note/audit and the previously delivered
D-141 migration differ. Exact owned original bytes/sidecars and Main/English/System are restored; the normal Release
remains installed/stopped. No physical-device, iOS, OS accessibility, provider, performance, Store signing/publication
or commercial-activation acceptance is implied.

Canonical Build-AndroidApk.ps1 produces artifacts/android/zanance-d147-release.apk, package pro.vafadar.zanance,
nondebuggable Release, intact ZIP, full ARM64/x64 assembly stores and application AOT, verified v2/v3 signature with
the existing local test certificate. Bytes: 81491883. SHA-256: `d3aa44afc6f55aae1ea3b4a0fe82700c5120ad196343afcd7cdcfbdf0d6879aa`.
No schema/model/migration, portable preference, security policy, credential, SDK, paid grant or permission change.

ENT-02/03 remain in progress. Continue remaining actual budget/new-work bindings, then other resources/operations,
import/restore/native paths and commercial messages under D-69. Commercial activation and owner/external gates stay
separate; this editor slice is not completion of the commercial release.

Evidence: `docs/quality/goal-editor-work.md`.

## D-148 - Selected budget definition boundary

Canonical scoped budget definition choice and separate current-work projection are implemented with
reviewed actual-file persistence. Save/Replace join or transfer chosen capacity atomically; Delete retains exact
membership checks and releases only the last current definition. Original history, paid-method corrections,
limits and financial rows remain intact. 34 new AT-150 cases; normal parallel main 2,594 / App.Tests 537 pass;
strict builds, normal Release native Save/Delete and six unchanged-editor language/theme checks, complete signed
APK and exact owned data/display restoration verified. Registration remains inactive. Budget chooser/view/alert
binding and other ENT-02/03 paths remain open. See [evidence](quality/budget-definition-choice.md).

## D-149 - Actual reviewed budget definition choices

The actual active-items form includes canonical budget definitions, grouped across copied periods with
original scope names/current methods and unselectable history. Covered review captures full account references;
explicit Save rechecks original metadata and writes only chosen definitions. Original account names stay exact
when display digits change. 13 new AT-151 cases; main 2,607 / App.Tests 550 pass; strict builds, 18 Windows native
chooser cases plus 18 registered Settings/help cases, six normal Release emulator cases, exact data/display restoration and complete signed
APK verified. Registration remains inactive. Effective budget/view/alert bindings and other ENT-02/03 paths
remain open. See [evidence](quality/budget-definition-chooser.md).

## D-150 - Actual current budget alerts

Actual alert orchestration checks every eligible original current budget across calendars/currencies/scopes,
with separate chosen-work rights and complete original net spending/carry. Read-only actual-file financial/privacy
reviews guard native publication; failed/retired batches retract attempted alerts and retain retryable device levels.
Carry no longer mixes another account definition. 25 new AT-152 cases; main 2,632 / App.Tests 575, strict builds,
six hidden Windows budget renders, six normal Release Android delivery cases (five with individual taps), a final rebuilt SDK-acceptance case and complete signed APK pass;
owned data/display restored. Enforcement remains inactive. Budget view/editor/scoped returning-data and other
ENT-02/03 paths remain open. See [evidence](quality/budget-alert-work.md).

## D-151 - Original budget notification destinations

Budget alerts now carry the opaque actual-file identity and original saved period id. Resolve after unlock and
again in the real budget page; reject another file, deleted identities and failed reads without guessing a
replacement. Retain original currency/calendar/period and monthly navigation coordinates without changing
Home currency or financial rows. Historical/unselected paid methods remain readable without granting new work.
14 new AT-153 cases; main 2,646 / App.Tests 589 pass. Strict Windows and complete strict Android Release pass;
six hidden Windows language/theme cases plus targeted native month navigation, and six normal signed Release
Android cases each tap four exact original currency/calendar/period destinations; owned data/display restored.
Commercial activation stays inactive. Budget view/editor commercial affordances and other ENT-02/03 paths remain
open. See [evidence](quality/budget-reminder-routing.md).

## D-152 - Original budget editor drafts

The original budget editor publishes complete references and defaults behind a loading cover. Exact original
id/file handoff retains archived/missing account/category limits and explicit scopes in both experience modes.
Raw amounts keep their input culture through live display changes. Save rechecks the complete review under the
actual SQLite writer; stale failures retain input and require explicit reload/review. Dirty fields alone survive
reload, unchanged fields adopt current saved values, and a committed form retires before native return.
Current new-tool rights are separate from retained corrections and future-period capacity. Registration remains
inactive. Budget view copy/delete/other work affordances and the remaining ENT-02/03 paths are still open.

35 new AT-154 actual application/isolated SQLite cases pass. Final ordinary main 2,681 / App.Tests 624 pass,
without failures/skips; outputs cleaned. Strict Windows and canonical complete strict Android Release pass
without warnings/errors. Eighteen hidden Windows cases cover en/fa/de, light/dark, 360/412/wide, native
validation/stale Save/Reload/Keep edits/Close and complete 25-table restoration. Six normal Release Android
language/theme cases verify original corrections/archived references; one explicit original-total Save preserves
all other metadata and ledger rows. Final normal Release Create/Close and a targeted weekly Create/Save verify
explicit absent identity and canonical zero stored month coordinates; complete owned data/bytes/display restored.
Physical device, iOS, paid activation and product publication are not claimed.

See [evidence](quality/budget-editor-drafts.md).

### D-153 - Original budget actions follow-up

Original budget view actions now use the complete displayed BudgetEditorReview for copy, confirmed replacement
and deletion, rechecked before/after confirmation and under the existing actual-file writer. Period lookup uses
original calendar/currency/explicit weekly dates and rejects ambiguity. Viewing, original correction and deletion
remain separate from paid new tools and net current-definition capacity; future periods do not consume today's
slot. Busy spans native confirmation through refresh. A committed operation whose refresh fails requires a
read-only Retry, without repeating Copy/Delete. Read-only opening no longer creates Settings; financial history
and all original calculation inputs remain visible. Current commercial registration remains inactive.

26 new AT-155 actual application/isolated SQLite cases pass. Final ordinary main 2,707 / App.Tests 650 pass
without failures/skips; outputs cleaned. Strict Windows and canonical complete strict Android Release pass with
no warnings/errors. Eighteen hidden Windows cases cover en/fa/de, light/dark, 360/412/wide, full native action
names/targets, retained paid history/correction, changed-confirmation rejection and read-only Retry. Six normal
Release Android language/theme cases verify actual original copy/delete confirmations; exactly one owned copy
and deletion of that copy preserve all original 25-table data. Original owned bytes/sidecars/Main/English/System
are restored, final signed Release installed/stopped. ENT-02/03 and remaining resource/operation/import/restore/
native paths stay open. Physical-device, iOS, provider, paid activation and publication acceptance are not claimed.

See [evidence](quality/budget-view-actions.md).


### D-154 - Quick-resource follow-up

Durable explicit quick-template/saved-filter choices retain every original packet, recheck revision/value and
same-timestamp changes, and use the existing actual-file scoped writer. Chosen new slots and explicit filter
replacement are atomic; retained correction/delete/history stay separate. Actual template create/apply/delete
and saved-query save/delete commands use complete reviews and one busy dialog/write/refresh guard. Queries are
captured before prompts; committed refresh failure never resubmits. Template names wrap, publication is covered
and explicit Reload is available. Six growing chooser destinations and help explain retained query history.
Current Release registration stays inactive; no schema, network, SDK, permission or portable grant is added.

29 new AT-156 cases/main 2,736 behaviours (App.Tests 679) pass after repairing one stale four-kind expectation;
only that failed case reran. Strict Windows/complete Android Release have zero warnings/errors. Eighteen hidden
Windows locale/theme/width cases and six normal Release emulator cases restore complete owned rows/bytes/display.
Physical-device, iOS, OAuth, commercial activation and publication gates remain open. ENT-02/03 are still in progress.

See [evidence](quality/quick-resources.md).

### D-155 - Read-only Home and original quick-template destinations

Home quick templates publish separate original activity availability after the complete parent read. Explicitly
available later definitions remain reachable within the existing six shortcuts; retained history and all original
financial calculations remain independent. A process-local TemplateVisit carries the reviewed actual-file/full
packet to the existing entry route. A changed/deleted original, reference, choice or right, or another actual file,
is rejected without guessing a newer same-id row or saving money. Failed navigation pins translated feedback and
requires explicit read-only Reload. The actual initial chooser receives only its typed resource kind, never a
selection. Destination feedback is visible beside Save; applying a template remains a detached draft.

Opening Home no longer creates or updates Settings for its layout fallback. Existing saved layouts remain exact;
the legacy device layout is read until an explicit profile-layout Save. Commercial registration stays inactive.
No schema, SDK, permission, network request, portable preference or entitlement grant is added.

21 new AT-157 actual-source/real SQLite cases pass. The ordinary main run passes 2,754 / App.Tests 697;
three focused name-order cases bring the verified total to 2,757 behaviours / App.Tests 700. The changed flow
class passes all 21 cases; the unchanged full suite is not repeated. Pending navigation awaits its actual event.
Outputs are cleaned. Strict Windows and complete strict Android Release have zero warnings/errors. Eighteen
hidden Windows Home/chooser contexts and eighteen focused destination continuations cover en/fa/de, light/dark,
360/412/wide. Six normal signed Release emulator cases open original Home templates, fill original amount/title
and cancel/discard without financial Save. Complete owned rows/bytes/display are restored. Physical-device, iOS,
OAuth, commercial activation and publication gates remain open; ENT-02/03 remain in progress.

See [evidence](quality/home-template-destinations.md).

## D-156 - Original device profile review

Original device profile choices now use the existing empty main id and exact original profile ids/names.
The actual Profiles form separates open/rename/delete from an explicit saved activity subset and unsaved choice.
One device preference publication contains the complete catalogue and scoped choice, with separate revisions;
legacy keys remain untouched and every catalogue/startup/backup-set reader uses the new packet after first mutation.
Opening reads only. Complete file/current-profile/provider/catalogue reviews guard publication, both delete
confirmations and creation; authentication is rechecked before committing a switch, with previous-path rollback
when that review retires. Unselected originals remain openable for retained history and correction.

Production device registration remains inactive. Per-file financial/new-money/automation bindings to the chosen
profile remain unfinished; this slice does not complete ENT-02/03 or activate commercial limits. No EF model,
schema, migration, permission, SDK, network request, credential or portable grant is added.

33 new AT-158 actual-source/real isolated SQLite behaviours pass. The ordinary main run passes all 2,790
tests (App.Tests 733), with no failures/skips; outputs are cleaned. Strict Windows and canonical complete Android
Release builds have zero warnings/errors. Eighteen hidden Windows en/fa/de, light/dark, 360/412/wide contexts
check actual native targets, complete growing captions, explicit choice Save, stale Save, retained drafts,
Cancel/Discard/Reload and unchanged complete fixture data. All review processes exit normally and exact owned
development bytes/sidecars are restored. Normal signed Release emulator checks and APK details are recorded in
the evidence document. Physical-device, iOS, OAuth, paid activation and publication gates remain open.

See [evidence](quality/local-profile-work.md).

## D-157 - Actual-file original profile activity

The original device profile choice now composes with the existing verified actual-file commercial source.
The legacy empty main id remains separate from the independently verified financial scope; changing the current
profile preference cannot transfer rights to another file. The immutable context retains the original plan,
resource choices and scope, plus complete catalogue/legacy/provider review facts. Original writer/snapshot
validation therefore rejects retired choices, including change-and-return revisions and changes while waiting
for SQLite ownership. Device choices grant neither paid tools nor shared-space membership.

New money, definitions, selected Plan/Goal/Budget work, template activity and future Plan/Goal reminders consult the same
profile condition. Complete original financial inputs, history, query viewing, corrections, refunds, overdue
settlements, deletion, backup/restore and owned export remain independent. A malformed/unlisted catalogue never
guesses main: new work stops while separately verified historical rights remain. Both current registrations
stay inactive; this slice does not activate limits or complete every operation/import/native binding.
No EF model, schema, migration, SDK, permission, network request, credential or portable grant is added.

31 new AT-159 actual-source/real isolated SQLite cases pass. The ordinary main suite passes all 2,821
behaviours (App.Tests 764), without failures/skips; test output is cleaned. Strict Windows and canonical strict
Android Release builds have zero warnings/errors. Focused original-page Windows and normal Release owned-emulator
results, exact data restoration, retained negative evidence and the complete signed APK are recorded in
[the evidence document](quality/profile-file-work.md). Commercial activation, physical-device, iOS, OAuth,
Store signing/publication and the remaining original-operation bindings remain open.

## D-158 - Original catalogue and period-review reminders

Original catalogue changes now reach the actual reminder watcher, so explicit activity choices rebuild the
queue without another financial action. The shared event port introduces no construction-time database read.
Subscriptions are lifetime-scoped and idempotent; a different catalogue cannot be substituted. Delayed work uses
the injected clock and exposes its actual full batch task for owned-lifetime checks. Disposal cancels future work,
detaches subscriptions and asynchronously drains current work without deleting valid native reminders.

Period-review delivery uses the same captured actual-file paid/profile facts. Complete original preferences,
first-recorded account date, language/formatting/calendar/digits and local day validate before/after native
publication. Revalidation never creates Settings. SDK request refusal is consumed for scheduled requests as well
as immediate alerts; partial pending work is withdrawn and Snooze cache commits only after successful complete
publication. Original financial rows and recovery remain independent. Current registrations stay inactive.
No EF/model/schema/migration, permission, SDK, network, credential or portable format change.

25 new AT-160 actual-source/real SQLite cases pass. The final ordinary main suite passes 2,846 tests
(App.Tests 789), with zero failures/skips, and output is cleaned. Strict Windows and canonical complete strict
Android Release build have zero warnings/errors. Original native Profiles Save drives the real watcher in an
independent fixture; complete rows/catalogue and owned development bytes are restored. Final normal Release
SDK delivery, exact owned restoration, APK details and negative evidence are recorded in
[evidence](quality/profile-reminder-work.md). Commercial activation, physical-device, iOS, OAuth and publication
remain separate. Original Plan/Goal financial-input retirement and other operation/native bindings remain open.

## D-159 - Original reminder input retirement

Original Plan rules/states, Goal/contribution/allocation packets and raw resource choices now retire a
reminder batch when any captured value changes, including changes at unchanged audit times or choice revisions.
Complete original accounts and the date-bounded ledger/quantity inputs used by the existing GoalProgress
calculator are captured in one deferred SQLite reader. Financial data is never filtered by activity selection.
The same coherent reader validates all original packets, preferences and first-data date before/after native
publication; a changed or failed preparation withdraws pending work and preserves the retryable Snooze cache.
Only needed ledger/quantity inputs are read. Future movements remain outside today's calculation.

Snapshot self-mutation rejection belongs to the reminder boundary: existing Goal editors can still mutate their
reviewed draft before the established explicit writer. Full raw selection values distinguish absent/empty
choices. No schema/model/migration, permission, SDK, network, credential or portable preference is added.
Commercial registrations remain inactive and test builds stay unrestricted.

24 new AT-161 actual-source/real SQLite behaviours pass; 100 related reminder/Goal editor/view cases pass.
Final ordinary main: 2,870 passed, zero failures/skips, App.Tests 813, 2m 03.711s; output cleaned.
Strict Windows and canonical complete Android Release have zero warnings/errors. Original running Goals pages
in en/fa/de at 412 pixels/dark verify stale Plan/financial retirement, reached-goal suppression, fresh retry and
complete 25-table restoration. Unchanged layout matrices and successful suites are not repeated.
APK signature/structure and all nine changed production-source PDB checksums match.
Native Release details and retained negative evidence are in the evidence document. Physical device, iOS,
OAuth, paid activation and publication are separate; ENT-02/03 and the commercial release are not complete.

See [evidence](quality/reminder-input-work.md).

## D-160 - Structured write feedback and retained filter retry

Original structured write rejections now explain quota counts, required Plus/Pro/add-on access, exact-space
membership and original profile/resource selection in all six languages. The shared native reporter keeps
unrelated failures on their original path and never guesses purchase, renewal, provider or activation state.
Pre-write Goal/Budget/quick-resource feedback retains the form; committed-return/reload feedback remains
distinct and never falsely says that the accepted write was not saved. Counts use safe Int64 addition,
current formatting/digit choices and direction marks; stored identities and exception details are not shown.

Saving a new filter above capacity now reaches the established reviewed atomic writer for its structured
reason. A rejected operation retires its review; the next explicit menu invocation rereads it without clearing
the current query. Exact raw filter names return to the name prompt. Name drafts are process-local and bounded
by original file identity, independently of rights; another file never inherits them. No automatic retry or
financial save, schema/model/migration, SDK, permission, network, credential or portable preference is added.
Production financial/device registrations remain inactive; test builds stay unrestricted.

19 new AT-162 cases pass with actual sources/resources and real isolated SQLite. Final ordinary main passes
2,889 / App.Tests 832, no failures/skips, 2m 49.493s, followed by cleanup. A preceding main run passed 2,885
before the real second-invocation fix; only the changed final behavior justified another run.
Strict Windows and canonical complete Android Release have zero warnings/errors. Eighteen actual Windows
reason/Close/second-Invoke cases cover en/fa/de, light/dark, 360/412/wide, with unchanged complete 25-table rows
and exact owned development bytes restored. Fictitious menu/name effects are explicit ports; reason presentation
uses the actual native adapter and buttons. Android evidence, negative artifacts and full signed APK are in
the evidence document. Platform/provider/device/commercial activation and publication gates remain separate.

See [evidence](quality/commercial-feedback.md).

Original configured SQLite targets now stay stable across open/closed Android reporting aliases.
The shared Data helper extends the existing D-146 approach to resource reviews, writers, Plan/reminder
packets, loan/backup boundaries and their unchanged foreign-file guards. Four added real SQLite cases
verify open readers/writers, coherent financial validation and rejection of another actual file.

## D-161 - Explain readiness before a blocked Save

New Goal and Budget editors explain their captured capacity, missing feature right or required explicit
selection before Save is disabled. The reason comes from the existing reviewed policy, uses all six real
translations and preserves complete raw drafts. WorkRestriction is an explanation, never a grant or a
replacement for the atomic writer. Existing budget net-definition/correction rules remain authoritative;
malformed bounded Goal choices require explicit repair, while unlimited access remains unaffected.
Production registrations stay inactive and test builds remain unrestricted.

Nineteen AT-163 actual-source/real SQLite cases pass. The final ordinary suite passes 2,908 tests,
App.Tests 851, zero failures/skips, in 2m 05.449s, followed by successful cleanup. Strict Windows and the
canonical complete signed Android Release build have zero warnings/errors. Thirty-six actual Windows
contexts cover en/fa/de, light/dark, 360/412/wide and Simple/Advanced, retaining complete drafts and all
25 tables; exact owned development bytes restore. Native Android regression and negative evidence are
reported separately in the evidence document. No schema/model/migration, permission, SDK, credential,
network or portable preference is added. Physical-device, iOS, provider and activation gates stay separate.

See [evidence](quality/pre-save-readiness.md).

## D-162 - Read-only plan comparison and actual access

More now opens Plans and access: a read-only comparison of the owner-approved Free/Plus/Pro model and
original current local access for this exact file. Comparing tiers changes only in-memory presentation;
counts and local tools come from existing Core QuotaPolicy/PlanPolicy. Current inactive test access never
becomes a fake Free/Plus purchase. Personal rights, exact shared membership, the host's right and original
profile choice remain distinct. All history, correction, backup/restore and owned export rules stay intact.

Only built local tools are compared. Unavailable Pro online services are an explicitly separate roadmap;
optional cloud backup belongs to every tier. Plus Lifetime is the same local Plus set, without invented
renewal. No price, purchase, trial, renewal, cancellation, restore-purchase or provider status is inferred.
Continue returns without changing a plan or buying anything; actual Free has the Continue with Free caption.
The existing explicit active-item form opens without saving. Production registrations stay inactive.

Seventeen AT-164 actual-source/real SQLite cases pass. Final ordinary main: 2,925 passed, App.Tests 868,
zero failures/skips, 2m 05.555s, followed by successful cleanup. Strict Windows and canonical full signed
Android Release have zero warnings/errors. Eighteen actual Windows contexts cover en/fa/de, light/dark,
360/412/wide, all three native tier choices, complete realized row captions/values and native help/return.
Actual Release Android More/chooser/comparison/help/Continue and exact owned restoration are verified.
All eight changed production-source PDB checksums match. No schema/model/migration, permission, SDK,
network, credential or portable paid data is added. Device, provider, billing and activation gates remain
separate. ENT-04 and the commercial release are not complete.

See [evidence](quality/product-plan-comparison.md).

## D-163 - Original editor write feedback and committed return

Account and Plan Save now explain actual structured quota/permission rejection in all six languages,
retain complete raw drafts and place complete feedback beside the pinned Save. Successful writes cannot
be resubmitted after a failed return or follow-up; inputs become read-only and Cancel becomes Close.
Account/default-preference boundaries stay distinct, including a default update that committed before
its subscriber failed. Original change-notification failures after commit remain visible through a typed
committed outcome, never a fake pre-write rejection. Exceptions are not silently swallowed.

Both editors use original native-effect ports and actual platform-independent application sources.
Native query interfaces stay on pages. Plan picker rows retain only their actual plain-text identity/name/
selection, without unused native color/icon allocation. Account and Schedule edit copies preserve all
original fields/identities; Schedule also clones its mutable rule. A refused historical split cannot mutate
the original in-memory state, stop boundary or automatic-post anchor before an explicit corrected retry.
Original validation, signs, calendars, currency locks, category selection, split rules and atomic writers
remain authoritative. No EF property/schema, migration, permission, SDK, credential or portable-format change.

21 AT-165 cases pass; final main passes 2,946 / App.Tests 889, zero failures/skips, 2m 07.788s, followed by
cleanup. Strict Windows and canonical complete signed Android Release have zero warnings/errors.
36 actual Windows contexts cover en/fa/de, light/dark, 360/412/wide and Simple/Advanced. Actual Save invokes
original atomic rejection/accepted writers over independent fictitious SQLite; raw drafts, pinned captions,
real input/Save enablement and Close are checked. Explicit fictitious return/consent effects are identified;
all 25 original tables and exact owned development bytes restore. Actual normal Android new-form/query
regression and exact owned restoration are separate from typed fixture/physical-device acceptance.
Production registrations remain inactive. Initial pre-attempt readiness and other operation/activation
coverage remain open; this does not complete ENT-04 or the commercial release.

See [evidence](quality/editor-write-feedback.md).

## D-164 - Reviewed atomic account archive

Account archive is now one reviewed SQLite transaction: original archive state, affected active/paused
plans in either account direction, exact default cleanup and original persisted activity choices commit
or roll back together. The reader captures complete original account/plan values and the local day without
creating settings. The writer reacquires/rechecks complete inputs under the actual file's writer and rejects
retired rows, day, cached access, another file or a different original notification owner.

Original Account/Plan feature/capacity decisions are shared, not duplicated. Archiving ends related plans
with established PlanActions; unarchive consumes the original account slot but never resumes ended plans.
Another concurrently chosen default remains untouched. Both original stores publish only after commit;
publication failures retain the accepted result and cannot cause a repeat. The UI blocks concurrent actions,
requires explicit consent before discarding a dirty draft, never silently saves those financial inputs,
and freezes an accepted result with Close after follow-up/return failure.

17 AT-166 cases pass. Final main: 2,963 passed, App.Tests 906, zero failures/skips, 2m 10.406s, followed by
cleanup. Strict Windows and complete signed Android Release have zero warnings/errors. 36 actual Windows
contexts cover en/fa/de, light/dark, 360/412/wide and Simple/Advanced with original native Archive/Close,
real SQL rollback and actual accepted account/plan/default writes over independent fictitious rows.
Explicit fictitious consent/alert/return effects are identified. Actual normal Android consent-decline
and exact owned restoration remain separate from typed fixture/physical-device acceptance. All four
changed production-source PDB checksums match. No EF property/schema, migration, permission, SDK,
credential, network or portable-format change. Production registration stays inactive; initial readiness
and other commercial paths remain open, not release completion.

See [evidence](quality/account-archive.md).

## D-165 - Account/Plan pre-attempt readiness

Account and Plan forms now explain original feature/capacity/selection decisions before an attempted
Save. The read-only review uses each original writer's actual configured file and cached access. Active
reads capture complete original rows and persisted choices in a deferred SQLite reader; inactive test
access performs no financial-row/choice read or paid activation. A missing persisted choice counts all
original eligible rows, matching the writer instead of a cached fallback subset. Original correction,
retained advanced-rule and historical net-slot behavior stays available.

The original advanced Plan classification is shared through Core PlanEditPolicy. Save and readiness build
the same detached candidate; readiness does not parse money, validate financial input, mutate original
state or grant a write. Explicit Refresh access keeps every raw amount/date/note/reminder/selection.
A failed or retired read disables Save with translated feedback; an actual writer rejection still retains
the draft and requires explicit fresh review. Atomic writers remain the final authority. No EF property,
schema/migration, permission, SDK/network, credential or portable-format change. Test limits stay inactive.

Fifteen AT-167 cases pass with actual application sources and isolated SQLite. The original 21 AT-165
cases also pass: known full quotas now disable Save before attempting it, so original writer-rejection
cases capture a free slot and then exercise a real later addition/access change. They still prove original
atomic rejection and an explicit corrected retry. Final main: 2,978 passed / App.Tests 921, zero failures
or skips, 2m 12.110s, followed by cleanup. Strict Windows has zero warnings/errors.

Remaining commercial bindings, activation and external/device acceptance stay open. See
[focused evidence](quality/editor-readiness.md).

## D-166 - Retained original import and Undo outcomes

Original ledger import, holdings import and durable Undo now retain the original accepted result across
post-commit change-subscriber failure. A typed completed notification carries the exact counts/batch or
Undo result; original atomic writers, metadata, overlap rechecks, rights and rollback stay unchanged.
The application retires the accepted reviewed payload before any history/failure follow-through and
removes an accepted Undo row before fallible reload. A retained old command cannot repeat that batch.
A complete history read publishes only after success, preserving other original rows on failure.

Structured pre-write rejection is shown beside the retained preview in all six languages. Successful
follow-through failures state the completed outcome instead of pretending it rolled back. Picker
cancellation keeps the existing file/preview/choices. One busy lifetime spans Undo consent/write and
export authentication; explicit fresh review retires failed original evidence without silently saving.
Picker, existing app-lock confirmation and UTF-8 BOM cache/share effects are native adapters. Actual
non-UI application sources are compiled and tested through explicit ports, never stand-in MAUI controls.
Pinned complete feedback/review/import actions reserve a growing row outside the viewport. Original
history identity and growing Undo action have separate rows. No new feature policy, paid activation,
schema/model/migration, SDK/permission/network, credentials or portable-format change.

32 AT-168 cases pass with actual application sources, real isolated SQLite and all six resource languages.
They cover original ledger/holdings permission refusal and retry, post-commit publication outcomes,
nonrepeatable accepted import/Undo, real history-read failure with other batch retention, picker/consent
cancellation and busy guards, explicit read-refusal/retry, security/export ports and neutral complete CSV,
real SQL-trigger whole-transaction rollback, plus explicit aggregate links and complete restored metadata.
Final ordinary main: 3,010 passed / App.Tests 953, zero failures/skips, 2m 42.936s, followed by cleanup.
Strict Windows and canonical complete Android Release have zero warnings/errors. All seven changed
production-source PDB checksums match. Device/platform/provider acceptance remains separate.

Other commercial bindings and external acceptance remain open; see [evidence](quality/import-outcomes.md).

D-167 completes original backup restore outcome handling and nonreplacing completion retry.
35 AT-169 cases/main 3,045 pass; strict builds, 36 Windows contexts, actual Release Android recovery and
complete signed APK verified. Current ENT-02/03/04 scope is audited next; external gates stay separate.
See [evidence](quality/restore-outcomes.md).

## Forecast/snapshot follow-through (D-169)

The original computation/atomic Save/history/Delete group is verified locally; retained Free data and
currency-safe legacy comparison are preserved. No commercial activation or external release acceptance.
Main 3,074 tests, strict builds, native Windows/Android evidence and complete signed installable APK:
artifacts/android/zanance-d169-release.apk. See [evidence](quality/forecast-work.md).
Next finite ready group: receipt recognition, followed by loan/report/PDF.

## Shared receipt follow-through (D-170)

Original Home/attachment recognition and typed editor source validation are delivered locally, with
original no-Save review and manual attachment policy intact. Main 3,104 tests, strict builds, 36 native
Windows contexts and both actual digital-PDF Release Android callers pass. Complete signed APK:
artifacts/android/zanance-d170-release.apk. [Evidence](quality/receipt-work.md).
Phone/iOS/camera/OCR corpus/provider/activation/release gates remain open. Next: loan/report/PDF.

## Original loan follow-through (D-171)

Loan analysis/confirmed payment writer are locally verified: main 3,141, strict clean builds, 36 native
Windows contexts and actual signed Release Android schedule/consent/ledger readback. Original balances,
manual repayment and essential warnings stay Free. Full signed APK: artifacts/android/zanance-d171-release.apk.
[Evidence](quality/loan-work.md). Next ready operation: reports/advanced PDF. Full release/external acceptance remains open.

## Original report/PDF continuation (D-172)

28 AT-173 application/real SQLite cases; ordinary main 3,169 / App.Tests 1,112 pass with zero
failures/skips (2m 42.749s), followed by test-output cleanup. Final strict Windows and canonical complete
Android Release builds have zero warnings/errors. Thirty-six en/fa/de, light/dark, 360/412/wide and
Simple/Advanced Windows contexts exercise real package targets, original calculations, Free refusal
without changing selection, detached actual PDF and unchanged original inputs. Final targeted PDFs
also retain Free account opening/movement/closing tables and per-account currency scopes; native goal
suggestion acceptance is checked in en/fa/de with its named-calendar rule and no ledger posting.
Normal signed Release Android exercises original report/history, actual PDF cache/platform share,
share-sheet cancellation and complete retained choices. Owned tables, cache, baseline bytes/sidecars
and Main/English/System are restored; final Release installed/stopped. Commercial registration remains
inactive. Physical phone/iOS/OAuth/billing/Store/performance/full-product acceptance remain separate.
The confirmed D-168 report portion is delivered; finite ENT-02/03 completion review is next.
Owner/external dependencies and full commercial-release acceptance remain open.
[Evidence](quality/report-work.md).

## Android protected storage delivery — D-263

The complete Android main application batch is implemented and locally verified with official
SQLCipher, automatic device keys, optional recorded recovery, all-profile lifecycle, retained portable
recovery, encrypted restore safety and reference-aware retirement. Final Android OS backup/transfer
exclusion is coupled to this runtime; portable passwords remain optional.

All 3509 corrected dependency tests passed without failures/skips and outputs were cleaned. Strict
Windows and complete Android Release builds passed. The final APK is signed, non-debuggable, uses
core runtime 10.0.13 and both reviewed native cipher payloads. Eighteen corrected native contexts cover
en/fa/de, light/dark and 360/412/wide layouts, original enrollment navigation, key-loss cover and actual
file-picker cancellation. Financial hashes and exact fixture envelopes were preserved.

[Complete evidence](quality/android-protected-storage.md) records the exact artifact/hash, observed
failures, native process-loss corpus and limits. Windows/iOS encrypted adoption, fresh hosted CI,
physical/OEM/provider/Store acceptance and the full canonical backlog remain open.

## D-281 automatic-copy extension

LOC-09 extends the original local backup flow with device-encrypted automatic recovery points;
portable export and first-run restoration remain separate. Current evidence and remaining platform
gates are recorded in quality/automatic-local-backup.md and the canonical commercial backlog.

D-293 adds locally qualified isolated service deployment and current main signed APK. It does not reopen finished
phase-1 checks or establish public mail/routing, phone/iOS or release acceptance. See quality/self-hosted-stack.md.

D-294 is an unfinished later household batch, tracked only in the canonical commercial backlog. Native actual-cost/editor and corrected Windows form evidence do not reopen/repeat successful Phase1 work or establish final household release.

### D-294 final local delivery

The complete local household batch is implemented and qualified together: protected E2EE membership/device/key
and optional recovery lifecycle; selected separate financial adoption and complete costs/conflicts; two-sided
ownership transfer; audit, permanent privacy intent/retirement and latest-marker-aware full service restoration.
Final service composition, bounded historical row reads, compact pre-allocation portable scrubbing, real main
Android upgrade/export, separate Release AOT/trimmed native allocation and native transfer-dialog geometry pass.
The original full run plus only899 exact failed-case reruns yields3753 passing existing cases;2854 prior successes
were not repeated. Separate focused cases do not change that total. Final product APK:
artifacts/android-household-final-d294/pro.vafadar.zanance-Signed.apk;91356917 bytes;
SHA2566ebe1f0d8f963f1c1f18cd2ecee7d03a4a5cfc5325d25e3883bdeee960ac38f2; signature/permanent id/arm64+x64 verified.
Exact scope, retained failures and runtime evidence are in enhancements/2026-10-commercial-release/11-household-delivery.md.
Earlier in-progress notes are historical. Public/commercial activation, physical/iOS, store/provider/signing,
external security review and publication remain separate gates; identity erasure and ciphertext recall are not
claimed. Continue the already approved complete billing/future-web-prerequisite batch without helper-only slices
or repeated unrelated successful checks.

## D-299 additive source metadata

The established manual-rate, holdings, portable-backup and financial synchronization invariants remain intact.
Optional reference provenance adds two application migrations and one service migration with regenerated compiled
models; neither delivered financial manifest changes. Current complete-batch evidence and native/package state
are in enhancements/2026-10-commercial-release/16-market-reference-delivery.md. Live source/rights/cost and
physical/iOS/release acceptance remain distinct; historical whole-suite3753 was not repeated.

## D-300 Android startup compilation

The existing protected startup and finance behavior remain intact. Qualify only the changed Android compilation/native startup boundary; no schema or whole-suite replay is required for method metadata. Physical/iOS/two-second and publication acceptance remain separate.

Current exact evidence: enhancements/2026-10-commercial-release/17-startup-responsiveness-delivery.md.

## D-331 IO-09 interpretation review

Own-format and mapped ledger CSV now expose bounded interpreted rows and invalidate changed mappings.
Focused tests and the signed offline build/upgrade pass; native/device qualification remains scoped in
[the evidence record](quality/interpreted-csv-preview.md). No financial schema/writer change or broad suite replay.

## D-332 interpreted-page navigation

The observed Android previous-bottom arrival is corrected and checked with actual Next/Previous,
stale generic review and the last invalid row. Native Windows18-context arrival and the complete
offline candidate pass; startup ANR/physical/iOS remain open. [Evidence](quality/android-import-preview-arrival.md).

## D-333 existing reminder lifecycle correction

The original cold notification action now prepares protected storage before financial reads; startup
failure/disposal preserves the original queue. Focused managed/native action and separate cold metadata
persistence pass, with strict builds and complete signed main upgrade. No Phase1/full-device/release gate
is broadly closed. See [evidence](quality/cold-protected-reminder-startup.md).


## D-336 Android packaging continuation

The observed pre-managed assembly-store abort comes from a cached CoreLib header retaining
index193 while the current descriptor table assigns CoreLib192 and Java.Interop193. Validate the
SDK's current compression-item metadata before its incremental timestamp check and regenerate only
incompatible owned cache entries. Seven focused behavior cases preserve valid cache timestamps,
invalidate stale index/size/magic/truncation, accept missing files and refuse outside destinations.
Keep the original SDK compression, serviced runtime, AOT profile, key/data and permissions. No unrelated
successful financial, OCR, backend or More-layout suite is repeated or new managed count claimed.
QA-06 startup ANR, two-second loaded Home, broader Android, Mac/iOS and owner release gates remain open.
[Evidence, failures and limits](quality/android-compression-cache.md).

## D-338 release-preparation evidence

Eight current native Windows draft screenshots in each existing language (en/fa/de/es/fr/it)
are delivered with exact RGB/source hashes and independent fictitious package/storage/non-input
desktop isolation. Five actual native pre-startup refusals, strict Windows/Android Debug builds and
48 visual/pixel checks passed. Only the rejected English budget loading frame was recaptured from
the same fictitious data; 47 successful frames were retained. Shipping UI/APK and managed counts
remain D-336. These are development drafts, not mobile or Store acceptance/publication. QA-06,
broader physical Android, Mac/iOS, provider/accounts and owner release gates remain open.

[Evidence and limits](quality/store-drafts.md).

## D-339 report reading correction

Category/composition report names, shares and monetary packets occupy independent growing rows.
Names retain native scaling and complete wrapping; oversized amounts use the existing horizontal
readout, outside the original category navigation button. The 18 final Windows contexts (en/fa/de,
Light/Dark, 360/412/wide at process-local 200%) and six original Release/AOT Android contexts pass
native glyph/viewport/scroll/target checks. Fictitious presentation inputs are explicitly separate
from report calculations; no financial commands execute. Strict builds and the full offline signed
APK pass. The Android caller's initial startup ANR is retained: Wait continued the same original PID,
without restarting its scenario. QA-06/ANR, broader A11Y/OS readers, physical Android, iOS and release
gates remain open. Managed test counts are unchanged; unrelated passed suites were not repeated.

[Evidence and limits](quality/report-legends-readable.md).

## D-340 budget caption correction

The remaining inherited RowTitle ellipsis truncates the original Non-monthly bills caption at
200% Windows process-local scale/360 width. The shared default now wraps with its original 15-unit
font and semantic color. All 26 other current consumers already explicitly wrap, so their effective
behavior is unchanged. Eighteen final Windows contexts/36 native captions and six Release/AOT
Android contexts/12 captions pass; original account/entry/budget inputs stay unchanged and no method
is saved. Strict builds and a complete signed offline APK pass. The independent Android startup
ANR remains an actual failure; Wait continued the same PID 1753 to its completed caption result.
Actual OS text scale/TalkBack, broader device/iOS/performance and release gates remain open. No
system setting, financial algorithm, schema, translation or managed unit count changes.

[Evidence and limits](quality/budget-group-titles-readable.md).

## D-341 verification maintenance

Repair standalone Data-test compilation against the original startup contract. The Home reuse
candidate is withdrawn after native qualification; application behavior and the D-340 signed APK
remain unchanged. QA-06 remains open.

[Evidence and limits](quality/home-publication-session.md).

## D-342 optional Home category correction

The actual constrained category name/amount and chart-hole total are corrected and checked in
18 Windows and six Release/AOT Android contexts. Original settings/accounts/entries are preserved;
no financial operation or saved layout change occurs. Existing unrelated successful checks are retained.
A11Y-03, QA-06/ANR, physical Android, Mac/iOS and external release gates remain open.

[Evidence](quality/home-category-legends-readable.md).

## D-343 shared plan-row correction

The original monetary packet no longer splits its digits/unit across lines in Home upcoming and
Plans rows. Eighteen Windows and six Release/AOT Android contexts qualify the shared correction,
with stored inputs unchanged. No unchanged domain or financial suite is repeated.

[Evidence and limits](quality/plan-row-amounts-readable.md).

## D-344 monetary list-row correction

Complete all six original ledger/account value surfaces together, including day/group headers,
selection and account color triggers. Eighteen Windows contexts are retained across failed/completed
runs; six original Release/AOT Android contexts pass. No financial writes or unit-count increase.
The independent Windows Canvas root-change failure is recorded separately, not fixed by this batch.

[Evidence and limitations](quality/ledger-account-amounts-readable.md).

## D-345 - Emulator accessibility qualification

Actual OS200%/412dp passes36 original monetary checks on retained fictitious data. Captured settings
are restored; TalkBack speech/navigation remains unaccepted. App/APK remain D-344, without replaying
unchanged successful builds or suites. [Evidence](quality/android-os-accessibility-qualification.md).

## D-346 actual OS qualification boundary

Original scalable financial surfaces gain real emulator OS200%/412dp evidence with unchanged
stored inputs. Retain completed cohorts and actual native/ANR failures separately. No serial-GC
workaround is promoted after an ineffective trial; speech controls do not establish TalkBack app
acceptance. App/APK remain D-344; broader A11Y-01/03, QA-06/07 and release gates stay open.
[Evidence and limits](quality/android-os-accessibility-qualification.md).

## D-347 actual foreground review boundary

A native layout under Android's ANR cover is provisional geometry, not unobscured-window acceptance.
Require actual Activity focus and reject retained receipts lacking that proof. Preserve completed
groups and actual failures separately; the ineffective precise-Tarjan trial is removed. Main/APK
remain D-344 and broader accessibility/runtime/platform gates stay open.
[Evidence and limits](quality/android-os-accessibility-qualification.md).

## D-375 - Home space reclaimed

Done: replace Home's bottom Add band with one compact title action. Preserve original financial
sections, bottom scroll reach, command and loading guard. Original Windows/Android layout and native
open/Cancel pass, including Samsung with unchanged Home 979 and about 88 dp more content height. No
financial writes or unrelated suite/benchmark repetition. [Evidence](quality/home-add-header.md).

## D-376 - Accurate Home guidance

Done: replace unrelated record-count completion with exact expense/recurrence/monthly-budget facts.
Fourteen focused policy cases, 18 Windows and six OS 200%/360 dp native Android contexts pass; strict
builds/full signed offline APK and no-reset emulator restoration pass. Existing financial algorithms,
creation defaults and dismissal choices are unchanged. [Evidence](quality/home-getting-started.md).

## D-377 - Original complete Home materialization

Reduce repeated parsing of standard empty tags without removing fields, weakening conversions or
changing UI/security. Nine new behavior cases, related Data tests and same-data native complete-page
comparisons qualify the bounded change. Preserve the observed native crash; general runtime and
loading acceptance remain unfinished. [Evidence](quality/home-empty-tag-materialization.md).


## D-385 - Complete bounded CSV replacement

Deliver the original native picker/worker/parser/publication flow together: reject whole oversized,
incomplete and empty replacements while preserving complete reviews/outcomes. Forty-six new managed
cases and focused native error checks qualify this behavior; no financial/schema or unrelated suite
change. [Exact evidence](quality/csv-input-safety.md). Broader acceptance remains in the canonical backlog.


## D-387 - Preserve CSV financial meaning at quote boundaries

Complete the observed shared-parser ambiguity through original Core/App regressions, compatible
writer/large-export/bank checks, original native error pages and a signed main package. No financial
Save or unsupported bank-format claim. [Evidence](quality/csv-quotation-integrity.md).
