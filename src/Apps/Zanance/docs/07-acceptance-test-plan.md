# 07 – Acceptance test plan

Automated tests live in `test/Apps/Zanance/*` and carry the scenario id in their name or a `[Trait("AT", "AT-17")]`.
Manual scenarios are executed on a real Android device with the **release** build (Gate 1B). The reference device and
data set (10,000 entries, 20 accounts, 100 active plans) are defined in slice S14.

| AT-57 | Restore on fresh install | BAK-12 | Integration + manual | S6 | Verified (integration: fresh install, balances/plans/states; D-62 adds protected/unprotected restore, preferences and no duplicate account. Windows UI Automation: cancel returns to step 3, encrypted restore opens Home with the original 3 accounts. Device uninstall/reinstall pending) |
| AT-58 | 11th backup, failed upload | BAK-07 | Unit (library: verified) | S6 | Library verified |
| AT-59 | Disconnect / switch Drive/OneDrive | BAK-13 | Manual | S15 | Ready to run: implemented (D-35, D-50), needs a build with OAuth clients on a device – connect, back up with protection on/off (D-62), list, restore both package types, delete a cloud backup, disconnect, connect another account; per provider on Android, iOS and Windows. Google's token protocol on iOS/Windows is unit-tested (`Vafadar.Authentication.Tests`) |
| AT-60 | Upgrade with old data | BAK-12 | Integration (migrations) | every slice | Verified (integration: first schema with data upgraded to latest; restore migrates older backups); re-run each slice |
| AT-61 | App lock with notification/export | SEC-02 | Manual | S13 | Implemented (lock on start/leave, taps after unlock, export/backup/restore confirmation); device check pending |
| AT-69 | Device-wide four-digit app PIN | SEC-01..04, D-63 | Unit + Windows UI + device | Maintenance | 20 PIN cases verified (set/change/remove, salts, delays/restart/rollback, concurrency, storage failure, recovery); Windows UI: cold start stays covered, incorrect PIN rejected, one-minute delay survives restart, change/removal need the current PIN, cancelled backup confirmation creates no file; en/fa/de both themes at 360/412/wide checked. Device authentication/recents and iOS pending |
| AT-72 | Clear plan and debt setup | D-65, REC, F2-DEBT, UX | Unit + running-app + device | Maintenance | 21 new unit cases cover calendar-anchored monthly dates, first-inclusive count, short months, translations, debt signs and unsaved transfer reminders. Windows fixtures check blank Once, monthly/count, explicit rule calendar, optional debt/receivable terms in en/fa/de light/dark at 360/412/wide. UI Automation: positive debt/receivable saves open details with correct signs, negative input rejected; monthly/custom follows the first day; saved reminder has unknown principal, automatic posting off and no new ledger entry; cancellation leaves schedules/ledger unchanged. Strict Windows/Android builds and 1121 tests pass. Physical-device acceptance remains open. |
| AT-71 | Receipt purchase-total evidence and review | D-64, F2, PRI | C# + Windows image/UI + device | Maintenance | Regressions first failed on the old parser/layout, then passed; six-language valid text samples, tax inclusion, token boundaries/signs/zero, non-money numbers, currency/unit conflicts and skew/separator/page fixtures checked. Windows actual image selection: inclusive-tax/EXIF receipts give 4.10, skew gives 24.90; two totals require a manual choice, USD/EUR conflict and missing total leave the draft blank. Saved JPEG reread gives 4.10; missing-total reread keeps existing 4.10. Choice/cancel, picker cancel, unreadable PDF and failed image preparation do not change ledger/attachments. 1100 tests and strict Windows/Android builds pass; en/fa/de both themes at 360/412/wide checked. Device/corpus acceptance remains ZCR-QA-05. |
| AT-70 | Android screenshot choice and ownership wording | SEC-02, PRI, D-63 | Windows UI + Android build/device | Maintenance | Settings/help/About verified in six-language resources and en/fa/de UI; Android build verified; physical recents/screenshot acceptance pending |
| AT-62 | Golden data §24 | §24 | Unit | S1 | Verified (unit: results, and their display in en/de/fa) |
| AT-65 | Allocate money to two goals | F2-GOAL-02/05 | Unit | P2-1 | Verified (unit: funded money never exceeds the balance; lower priority loses funding first; completed goals release their earmark) |
| AT-66 | Splits, partial payments, final settlement | F2-TX-01/02 | Unit | P2-3 | Verified (unit: split changes the balance once, each budget sees its share; data: partial payments keep the occurrence open with the outstanding rest, the forecast expects only the rest, the final payment settles, auto-post never pays twice, delete and undo adjust the paid amount) |
| AT-63, 64, 67, 68 | Other phase-2 scenarios | F2-* | – | Phase 2 | Not included |

## D-67 acceptance additions

| Scenario | Requirement | Evidence and remaining device acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| AT-73 | Discover and restore connected backups from previous profiles/installations; optional protection | Library regressions cover all-set discovery, foreign-app exclusion, unchanged set retention, protected/unprotected preference restore and old packages. Rendered destination empty/error/files and device-file fallback. Real Google/OneDrive account flows, upload/download/delete and fresh-phone recovery remain AT-59 device acceptance. |
| AT-74 | Language independent of regional display | English + German numeric formats; Persian RTL with Latin/Persian digits; explicit choices survive language/restart; invalid saved choices fall back; converted-calendar numeric order and date field order. Onboarding/settings examples and help checked in en/fa/de, light/dark, 360/412/wide. Android native pickers and device acceptance remain pending. |


## AT-75 - Independent encryption feasibility (D-68 / SEC-01)

Four separate Windows harness tests pass: encrypted DB/WAL marker controls, SHM leakage check (not encryption),
wrong/missing key, integrity, ciphertext change, rotation/export, EF entity round-trip, DPAPI profile context and
PBKDF2/AES-GCM envelope authentication. Fixture data only. Android complete signed Release AOT/trimmed APK passes
on API 36 x86_64: common encryption checks on two fresh processes, Keystore-wrapped profile recovery after force-stop,
unchanged envelope/database hashes and envelope-tamper rejection. No main package was installed on the isolated AVD.
No production encryption, ARM64 device, iOS runtime, hardware-backed guarantee or crash-safe migration acceptance
is implied. ADR acceptance remains pending owner review. See proposed ADR 0010 and experiments/Zanance.Encryption.


## AT-76 - Build-specific SDK and Android permission boundaries (D-69 / SEC-09)

Eleven PowerShell policy cases cover the current allowlist, wrong network variant, unexpected privileged capabilities,
wrong package, Debug and missing reminder capability. Complete signed Offline and Cloud Release APKs pass their
explicit guards; the Cloud artifact is rejected under the Offline policy. SDK inventory and qualified privacy copy
are documented. These tests do not prove native SDK traffic, real OAuth, signed iOS privacy labels or future SDKs.

## AT-77 - Goal contribution reminders (D-70 / LOC-02)

Twelve Core cases cover month-end anchors, two-week intervals/count endings, Persian rule dates, lifecycle and
source exclusions, reaching/withdrawal, opt-out, missed-date exclusion, stable ids and pending bounds. Seven linked
coordinator/SQLite cases use actual app texts in en/fa/de and check generic defaults, opted-in names, grouping,
permission denial without refresh-time prompts, pause/reached/archive/disable cancellation, and no ledger/allocation
writes. Main suite: 1,153 passed. Goal editor and help are checked in en/fa/de, light/dark, at 360/412/wide.
Android API 36 x86_64 fixture passes actual native 09:00 pending requests (October +02:00, November +01:00),
generic notification delivery, tap to goal details, pause cancellation, resume and saved opt-out after process restart;
ledger/allocation counts remain zero. Complete signed Release APK signature, ZIP, package, embedded arm64/x86_64
assemblies/app AOT and Cloud permission guard pass; actual emulator install/cold start pass. Release metadata excludes
both Debug fixture types. ARM64 phone, Doze/reboot and iOS acceptance remain open. The opt-in Android Debug fixture
requires an empty installation or its own marked single account, never existing user data. It verifies normal 09:00 pending requests before expediting one fictitious
notification for delivery/tap testing without changing system time. This does not prove exact-time or battery-policy
delivery.
